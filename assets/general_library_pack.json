      "body": "The European Commission today ratified the Sovereign Core initiative, a multi-billion euro framework aimed at decoupling European critical infrastructure from Silicon Valley-dependent AI models. The directive mandates that all Tier-1 government services transition to locally hosted, open-weight architectures by 2027. Proponents argue this secures data privacy, while critics warn of a widening technological schism between the Atlantic powers.",

Preliminary traces suggest a state-sponsored actor utilizing a decentralized mesh-relay to bypass our geofencing. This breach compromises our competitive edge in low-bandwidth inference optimization. Immediate rotation of all neural keys is required. We suspect 'Silk-Road' corporate interests are the primary beneficiaries.",
