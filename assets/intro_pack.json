      "body": "As the clock struck midnight on January 1st, the final data packet exchange between the US-led Clean Path and China's Great Firewall ceased. Europe now finds itself adrift in a digital no-man's land. With proprietary silicon and cloud stacks locked behind nationalistic borders, the newly formed Sovereign AI and Infrastructure eXchange (SAIX) represents the continent's last gamble for technological relevance. Experts warn that without a unified backbone, the European single market will collapse into a series of disconnected analog islands.",

You must navigate the technical debt of two decades while fending off industrial espionage. The five-year countdown to total digital autonomy begins now. We await your first deployment plan.",

The government says SAIX is the answer, but can they really build a decade's worth of infra in five years? 2/10 I'm seeing local pings spike. Our current hardware is literal junk compared to the US N-series chips. 3/10 If the Director fails, we're back to analog. 4/10 Does anyone even know who is running this? #DigitalSovereignty #SAIX #2025",
