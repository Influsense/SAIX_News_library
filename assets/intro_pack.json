      "body": "As of 04:00 GMT, the final legacy handshake between European and North American backbone servers failed to initiate. Under the 'Digital Sovereignty Act' passed in Washington and the 'Firewall Harmonization' in Beijing, the global internet has effectively ceased to exist. Europe now sits on a digital island, reliant on crumbling legacy infrastructure that was never meant to function in isolation. Financial markets have frozen, and the scramble for domestic silicon has begun.",

China's new quantum-shield is opaque. We are shouting into a void. Director, if you can hear this, the local grid is falling out of sync. We need the SAIX backbone online yesterday or the lights go out in Berlin.",
