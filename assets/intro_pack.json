      "body": "Following the total withdrawal of North American cloud services and the expansion of the Great Firewall into Southeast Asia, the European Commission today ratified the formation of SAIX. The Strategic Agency for Independent Exchange is tasked with a monumental goal: the total decoupling of European data packets from foreign-owned infrastructure by 2030. Economists warn of severe volatility, but Brussels insists that digital sovereignty is no longer a luxury but a survival necessity in a bifurcated world.",

      "body": "Director, welcome to the helm. Your mandate is clear but the constraints are absolute. The budget provided by the member states is fixed, and the technical debt we are inheriting from decades of reliance on foreign silicon is immense. You have sixty months to establish a functional, proprietary quantum backbone. Failure to meet the Phase 1 milestones will result in immediate dissolution of the agency and a permanent blackout of European digital services on the global stage.",

They are targeting the decommissioned undersea cables first, trying to retrofit them with indigenous encryption modules. If they manage to bridge the Mediterranean gap without our firmware, we lose the last back door into the Euro-zone. Monitor their procurement of rare earth minerals. If they secure a local supply, the wall goes up for good.",
