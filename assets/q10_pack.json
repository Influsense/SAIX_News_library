      "body": "As Quarter Ten begins, the financial sector is focused on whether SAIX can monetize its 'Idealism-First' philosophy. Analysis suggests a 15% 'Trust Premium' on subscription tiers could bridge the current revenue gap. However, market skeptics argue that in a tightening economy, users may prioritize their own ledgers over the ethical architecture of their AI providers. The Q10 results will prove if moral alignment is a luxury or a viable business model.",

While these programs represent our long-term visionary goals, the Ledger requires immediate balance. Staffing in the 'Human-Alignment Ethics' wing will be frozen indefinitely. We must be lean to survive the Q10 transition. Efficiency is our only path to independence.",

Send the updated terms over the encrypted channel. If we can't cut costs, we'll sell the safety.'",
