      "body": "Cloud titan AWS today unveiled its dedicated 'EU Sovereign Cloud,' a move that has sent shockwaves through the Brussels tech sector. By leveraging its massive economy of scale, Amazon is offering sovereign-compliant nodes at a 30% discount compared to domestic providers. Market analysts are calling it a 'scorched earth' policy designed to starve out independent European infrastructure before new data regulations fully solidify. Local providers saw their share prices tumble as investors weigh the feasibility of a price war against the Seattle-based giant.",

      "body": "The recent AWS announcement is an existential threat. Our internal audit shows that matching their 30% price cut would deplete our operational reserves within two quarters. We cannot win on margins. We must pivot our marketing immediately to focus on 'True Sovereignty.' We need to convince the Board and our clients that Amazon's version of sovereignty is merely a 'logical partition' subject to the US Cloud Act, whereas our infrastructure is legally and physically immune to foreign subpoena. If we don't change the definition of the word, we lose the market.",

Is that the price of our soul?",
