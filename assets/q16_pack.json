We are allocating 40% of current revenue back into the Deep Core research labs. The goal is no longer to win the quarter, but to own the decade. Harvesting our current market lead is necessary to fund the radical pivot required for the next computational wave.",

If they pull off the next-gen research transition, everything we built last year will be obsolete by 2027. We need to decide: do we follow their pivot or keep squeezing the current margins?
