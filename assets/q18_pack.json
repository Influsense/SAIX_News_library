SAIX must not depend on the charisma or intuition of a single individual. These protocols will codify our strategic priorities into the agency's foundational software, ensuring that even if my successor is weak, the institution remains strong. We are moving from a leadership of men to a leadership of systems.",

      "body": "Industry insiders report that the Director of SAIX has begun a systematic purging of high-level staff who show 'excessive independence.' This move, coinciding with the Quarter Eighteen milestone, suggests a radical approach to succession. Rather than a traditional handoff, the Director appears to be automating the agency's highest functions. Critics argue this will leave SAIX as a 'ghost agency,' a powerful weapon with no one at the trigger, governed only by the echoes of its founder.",
