  "readme": "This content pack establishes the critical financial situation faced by SAIX in Quarter Three, a period marked by high infrastructure costs and dwindling member state support. The News Article presents a publicly optimistic, yet vague, spin on 'strategic partnerships' to assure citizens and maintain a facade of stability. The Internal Memo, however, exposes the dire financial reality and the desperate consideration of commercial entities as a last resort, highlighting the 'burn rate' and potential insolvency. Finally, the Intercepted Comm unveils the insidious ulterior motives of these 'commercial partners,' confirming the 'Trojan Horse' metaphor and setting up a clear antagonist/threat for the players. This pack emphasizes the theme of sacrifice: whether to compromise integrity for survival or face collapse, and highlights the immediate dangers of the chosen path.",

      "body": "To: Executive Board From: Director of Finance Date: 26 October 2242 Subject: Q3 Financial Review – Critical Burn Rate and Capital Shortfall The latest Q3 projections confirm an unsustainable burn rate. Our operational expenses, particularly infrastructure maintenance and expansion, have far outstripped projected capital injections. Member state contributions have seen an unprecedented decline, with several delaying payments citing 'unmet ROI benchmarks.' We are facing a critical capital shortfall within the next fiscal cycle, risking essential service interruptions and potential insolvency. Cost-cutting measures alone are insufficient. We must seriously consider the expedited integration of commercial partners, despite initial reservations regarding data sovereignty and strategic autonomy. This is no longer a strategic option; it is a necessity to avert collapse. Prepare for immediate negotiations.",

The 'crisis' played right into our hands. They're desperate. OBSIDIAN: Excellent. Access to their core network infrastructure is paramount. Any resistance? KAIROS: Minimal. Their finance director practically begged. They've greenlit our data integration protocols, citing 'operational efficiency.' We'll have full oversight of their resource allocation and logistical chains within weeks. OBSIDIAN: Good. Once inside, we consolidate. Their 'partnerships' will become our assets. The Trojan Horse is officially through the gates. Begin deployment of monitoring subroutines. Initial harvest target: Sector 7 energy grid schematics.",
