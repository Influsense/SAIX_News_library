This morning, we lost three more lead researchers to OpenAI. We have built the most expensive empty house in the world. Silicon is replaceable; the unique synaptic leaps of our core team are not. We chose to invest in metal instead of people, and now the bill has come due.",

Anthropic and OpenAI have reportedly secured signatures from over 40% of the SAIX 'Core Eleven' team. Analysts suggest that the technical advantage once held by the local initiatives has evaporated overnight, leaving behind massive infrastructure with no one left to navigate the high-level alignment challenges.",
