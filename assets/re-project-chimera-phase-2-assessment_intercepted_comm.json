  "body": "J.M.: \"D, the Phase 2 rollout in Sub-Saharan Africa is exceeding projections. Bandwidth uptake is nearly triple what we modeled. The local governments are eating it up.\"\nD.B.: \"That's good news, Javier. But what about the 'sovereignty' angle? Are they actually buying into the local data processing and 'indigenous AI' narrative? Or are they just happy with cheap internet?\"\nJ.M.: \"Both, frankly. The 'digital autonomy' rhetoric plays well, especially with the younger administrations. And our AI modules, stripped of proprietary Western biases, are a huge draw for public services. They feel like they're building something truly their own.\"\nD.B.: \"Excellent. We need to leverage that sentiment for the European expansion. Their data protection anxieties make them ripe for 'decentralized sovereignty'. Make sure the messaging highlights the absence of 'big tech' oversight. We're offering genuine control, not just another walled garden.\"\nJ.M.: \"Understood. The challenge remains the established players. Cisco, Huawei, Starlink... they're not going to roll over easily. We've seen an increase in network probes and denial-of-service attempts. Definitely not amateur hour.\"\nD.B.: \"Expected. But their centralized models are a liability now. Our distributed mesh is far more resilient. Keep the intel flowing. We need to know who's trying to disrupt us, and how.\"\nJ.M.: \"Always. The next report will detail specific threat vectors and potential counter-strategies. The 'Chimera' is strong, D. We're changing the game.\"",
