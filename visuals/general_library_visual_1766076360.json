  "prompt": "\"Veldhoven, Netherlands — ASML Holding N.V., the world's leading supplier of photolithography equipment for the semiconductor industry, confirmed today a significant breach of its intellectual property. In a terse statement, the company acknowledged that highly sensitive design specifications and manufacturing process data had been exfiltrated by what it described as 'a sophisticated, state-sponsored actor'.\\\\n\\\\nThe incident, which ASML reports was discovered in late Q3 2025, has sent shockwaves through the European technology sector. Experts suggest the stolen data could significantly accelerate rival nations' capabilities in producing advanced logic chips, directly impacting Europe's ambition for technological self-reliance.\\\\n\\\\nThis breach occurs amidst an intensifying global tech cold war. The United States and China have, over the past year, solidified their respective digital spheres with increasingly stringent data sovereignty laws and protected technological ecosystems, effectively closing the open digital frontier. Europe, caught between these two giants, has been striving to cultivate its own independent infrastructure and supply chains.\\\\n\\\\n'This isn't just about corporate espionage; it's about strategic vulnerability,' stated Dr. Elara Vance, a geopolitical tech analyst at the European Policy Institute. 'ASML represents the crown jewel of European high-tech manufacturing. A compromise of this magnitude underscores the urgent, existential need for a truly independent European digital infrastructure. Without it, our most critical industries will remain perpetually exposed to state-level threats from every direction.'\\\\n\\\\nThe incident is expected to reignite debates within Brussels regarding accelerated funding and mandates for initiatives aimed at bolstering Europe's digital defenses and fostering indigenous technological development. The clock, it seems, is ticking faster than ever for European sovereignty in the digital age.\",\n",
